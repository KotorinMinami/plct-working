CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindTBB.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "TBB", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "TBB" with any of
  the following names:

    TBBConfig.cmake
    tbb-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "TBB" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "TBB_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "TBB" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (add_executable):
  Target "testcc" links to target "TBB::tbb" but the target was not found.
  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED target, or an
  ALIAS target is missing?
